# Boston Residential Property Valuation Model

## Credit to 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp

## Introduction

Welcome to 1970s Boston, Massachusetts! As an employee of a real estate development company, your mission is to create a model that estimates the price of residential properties. The model will consider various home characteristics, including:

- Number of rooms
- Proximity to employment centers
- Socioeconomic status of the neighborhood
- Student-to-teacher ratios in local schools

# Key Takeaways for Your Boston House Price Prediction Project

1. **Data Exploration and Analysis**:
   - Dive into the Boston house price dataset to understand its features, distributions, and potential relationships.
   - Visualize data patterns, correlations, and outliers.

2. **Data Splitting**:
   - Divide your dataset into training and testing subsets.
   - Ensure that your model learns from one portion and generalizes well to unseen data.

3. **Multivariable Regression**:
   - Implement a regression model that considers multiple predictors (features) simultaneously.
   - Linear regression is a common choice for predicting continuous outcomes like house prices.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assess the model's performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared.
   - Understand how well your model captures the variability in actual house prices.

5. **Coefficient Interpretation**:
   - Analyze the coefficients of your regression model.
   - Interpret their impact on the predicted house prices.

6. **Residual Analysis**:
   - Examine the residuals (differences between predicted and actual prices).
   - Ensure that your model's assumptions hold.

7. **Data Transformation**:
   - Apply transformations (e.g., log, square root) to features if needed.
   - Improve model fit and address nonlinearity.

8. **Property Price Estimation**:
   - Once your model is ready, use it to estimate house prices based on input features.
